# pricebot
Bitcoin info for signal groups

* Depends on [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/)
* In `bitcoin.conf`, individual signal contacts start with `+`, groups start with `-g ` followed by the groupid
* Run with one of the `signalcontact` key values as an argument. Example:
```
python pricebot.py groupname
```
